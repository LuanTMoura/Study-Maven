# Study-Maven

In this repository, I aim to attach content that I have learned about Maven. All annotated content will be in the Markdown file [at this link](https://github.com/LuanTMoura/Study-Maven/blob/main/Maven%20Study%20Notes.md). Finally, all supporting files and examples from learning sources can be found in the repository where you are reading this text.
